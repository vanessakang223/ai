        The text prompts and imagery in this web design project blend to create a reflective experience on the impact of AI and societal ideals. Each prompt poses a philosophical question—like whether an ideal society can exist without bias or how AI reshapes our understanding of labor—paired with surreal, dreamlike visuals. These images, ranging from soft landscapes to industrial scenes, evoke themes of utopia, transformation, and ambiguity, enhancing the depth of each question and inviting users to ponder the complexities of AI and humanity's future.
